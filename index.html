Summary
As an accomplished DevOps/SRE engineer with over 7 years of experience, I have excelled in various aspects of
IT operations, including configuration management, change and release management, system administration, and
support in Linux environments such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Ubuntu, and CentOS.
My expertise lies in automating builds and deployment processes using a diverse set of DevOps tools across
leading cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, and Azure. I have consistently leveraged automation techniques to
streamline software delivery and optimize efficiency.
With a specialization in architecting and building cloud platforms, I have demonstrated my proficiency in creating
and automating Kubernetes-based environments specifically designed to run microservices. This expertise has
enabled me to architect scalable and resilient solutions.
Throughout my career, I have cultivated a strong skill set encompassing Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, Puppet,
Ansible, Nginx, GIT, GitHub Actions, GitLab, Jenkins, and other essential DevOps tools. These tools have been
instrumental in driving seamless development workflows and ensuring the smooth functioning of systems.
In addition to my extensive experience, I hold certifications as a Kubernetes Certified Administrator (CKA),
Kubernetes Certified Security Specialist (CKS), and AZ-104 (Microsoft Azure Administrator Associate). These
certifications validate my in-depth knowledge of Kubernetes, as well as my proficiency in managing and securing
cloud environments.
I am deeply passionate about leveraging DevOps principles and cutting-edge technologies to optimize IT
operations, drive scalability, and enhance reliability. I am excited to take on new challenges and contribute to the
success of organizations in need of a skilled and certified DevOps/SRE engineer.
